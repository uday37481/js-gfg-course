# js-gfg-course
A code repo for JavaScript concepts

1️⃣ File: variable.js
This file teaches how to use variables in JavaScript and how to show output in the console.

🔍 What I learnt :
Using console.log() to print output.
Creating variables using var, let, and const.
Assigning and re-using values.
Basic text and number outputs.




2️⃣ File: Arithmetic.js
This file focuses on arithmetic and comparison operations in JavaScript.

🔍 What I learnt :
Basic math: add, subtract, multiply, divide.
How numbers and strings behave differently.
Comparison operations: greater than, less than, equal, etc.
Using variables with numbers and strings.
How to handle user input safely.




3️⃣ File: condtn.js
This file helps you understand conditional statements, functions, and loops in JavaScript.

🔍 What I learnt :
Use of if, else, and ternary (? :) statements.
Check eligibility based on marks.
Use of the ?? (nullish coalescing) operator.
Writing and calling functions.
Arrow functions.
Looping through characters in a string.




4️⃣ File: loops.js
This file demonstrates different types of loops in JavaScript and how to use them.

🧠 What I learnt :
for loop: repeats a task a certain number of times.
while loop: repeats while a condition is true.
do...while loop: always runs at least once, then checks the condition.
How to loop through the characters in a string.



5️⃣ File: pattern.js
This file teaches you how to use loops to print fun patterns using stars (*) and numbers.

🧠 What I learnt :

How to repeat characters using loops.
Create triangle patterns with * or numbers.
Build patterns like Floyd's triangle.
Use nested loops for complex output.

✅ Example Patterns:
Increasing and decreasing stars
Number triangle
Floyd's Triangle
Full diamond like number triangle




6️⃣ File: function.js
This file introduces functions — a way to reuse blocks of code.

🧠 What I learnt :
Defining and calling functions.
Passing values (arguments) to functions.
Anonymous functions (functions without a name).
How to store a function in a variable and call it.




7️⃣ File: function2.js
This file introduces special types of functions and how they work in JavaScript. You’ll learn how functions can be called immediately, delayed, or used in response to user actions.

🧠 What I learnt :
Named function expression (with recursion)
Callback functions
IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
Event handling in the browser

✅ Key Examples:
🧮 Factorial using a Named Function
⏳ Callback Function with Delay
⚡ IIFE (Runs Immediately After Definition)
🖱️ Event Handling on a Web Page



8️⃣ File: function3.js
This file explores different types of functions that return values, including arrow functions, pure functions, and loops inside functions.

🧠 What I learnt :
Writing functions that return results
Using arrow functions for short syntax
Ternary operators inside functions
Using loops in functions for calculations

✅ Key Examples:
➗ Pure Function to Divide Two Numbers
🔁 Arrow Function to Find Remainder
🔢 Ternary Inside Arrow Function
